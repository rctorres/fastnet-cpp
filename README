Package dependencies:

  1) Scons (for compilation / installation)
  2) gcc/ g++
  3) Python 2.7 or above
  4) MATLAB 2011 or above (certified until 2013a)

Installation instructions:
  1) Get latest release from github (https://github.com/rctorres/fastnet)
  2) Go to build directory
  3) Call the configure script by issuing (add -h if you want to look at the configuration options):
      ./configure
  4) Compile / install everything by calling:
      scons install
  5) After compiling / installing everything, scons will create a wrapper script (also called matlab)
     that, instead of directly calling matlab, it will first setup the environment so matlab can
     find fastnet scripts. This wrapper is installed in EXECINSTDIR (call .configure -h to check where it is)
     to make things easier, you can add this directory to your PATH so by calling matlab, you will directly
     setup fastnet and then call matlab. The script is smart enough to pass on to matlab any command line 
     parameter you pass to it.
