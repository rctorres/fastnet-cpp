  @brief    The BackPropagation training class.
  @author    Rodrigo Coura Torres (torres@lps.ufrj.br)
  @version  1.0
  @date    14/11/2004

  This class implements the backpropagation training algorithm.
  it can perform either online and batch training, since the
  instant gradients are automatically accumulated every time the
  new weights values are calculated and also the class keeps control
  of how many inputs have been applied to the network, so the instant gradient
  is used at the update weights phase if only one input was applied, and the mean
  gradient will be used if multiple inputs were presented to the network. The class
  also automatically resets the accumulated values after an epoch, preparing itself
  for the next epoch, so the user just have to use the methods, without worring
  about internal control.
